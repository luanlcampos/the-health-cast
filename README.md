# Health Cast App

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59520945/182224394-6b477155-2516-4977-94af-d6827edeed6f.png)

COVID-19 exposed several gaps in how health information is poorly disseminated. With a growing number of online resources in social media, health blogs, forums, and podcasts, it is challenging to determine which sources remain reliable and trustworthy. The Health CAST app aims to unify the most efficient communication tools into one platform. The system incorporates the following features: a live streaming tool for health care professionals (HCPs) to host public health webinars, a forum for users to inquire and discuss with the community, and a database of exclusive health livestream recordings for users to educate themselves on health topics covered by verified, medical specialists. The platform will be consistently monitored and verified, ensuring all the content creators will be specialists in the health domain they are discussing. 

From the HCPsâ€™ perspective, The Health CAST Application offers a safe environment where only users with a genuine concern or question on a health-related topic will visit. By focusing on specific health-related topics delivered by verifiable public health organizations, the application targets users interested in the health domain to voluntarily participate, which is a focus that is largely absent on larger social media platforms. Our platform also aims to engage healthcare providers wishing to promote their information online without being drowned out by the popular influencers typically found on larger platforms. 
At the height of the pandemic, many hospital staff were overwhelmed by the overcapacity of visitors even for patients with milder symptoms and ailments. To reduce the strain and overreliance in hospitals, The Health CAST provides affiliated healthcare organizations and HCPs with a tailored health media platform to promote public healthcare information and announcements to the community. In doing so, The Health CAST also serves as a centralized social media platform for large health bodies to improve public relations with the Ontario citizens. 

For a typical user, The Health CAST app facilitates quick web searches through past discussions according to their needs and interests. Much like HCPs on larger social media platforms, an ordinary user is typically overwhelmed by endless sources of unreliable health information that may have been unverified by a medical professional. In this case, our platform also becomes a gateway where concerned users can engage in secure, online conversations through forums and webinars with healthcare professionals to look for professional advice and assistance.
